# React News App

### We are creating this MERN project. This will be React app powered by Node.js backend. A realtime API used to fetch data from web. And news are updated in real time.

## Who can contribute?
### Any designer or developer can contribute.

## How to install the project on local machine?
The project is created with MERN stack. So first need to install dependecies used in Backend with **npm insall** and then by writing **cd client** move to client directory from root directory and install React dependencies by again writing **npm install**.
Then write **npm start** to run the app.
This will start the app in your browser at **localhost:3000**
